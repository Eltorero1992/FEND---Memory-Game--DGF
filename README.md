## Motivation

This game is the final coursework for section 2 of the Front-End Developer Nanodegree course by Udacity.

## Build Status

Finished on laptop version

Finished on mobile version but not tested

Finished on tablet version but not tested

## How to Play

Click on one of the cards, the card will be turned up and will reveal a symbol, click on another card, if both symbols match, the pair will remain up and will change green to indicate you matched a pair. If not, it will shake red. Remember the symbols and pairs and try to match them all.

You start with 3 stars, as you fail to make pairs you will lose starts.

The game will end either once you have matched all the pairs or you run out of stars, so think twice before you make your next move!
